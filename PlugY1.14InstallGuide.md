# How to Install PlugY for Diablo 2 version 1.14d


###### Note: This version of PlugY has been unofficially updated for 1.14d by a third party. It was not released or reviewed by the original PlugY author, Yohann. Be careful of bugs and backup your saves regularly!


#### As usual, the PlugY files being in your Diablo 2 folder may risk you getting banned if you connect to the Battle.net even without PlugY loaded. As such, you should have a separate installation for PlugY if you also want to play on Battle.net.


1. **Install Diablo 2 as normal.**
	1. *If you already have Diablo 2 1.14d installed, you can simply copy and paste the Diablo 2 folder and rename it to something that indicates it is your Diablo 2 for Battle.net.*
		- They way PlugY works, PlugY has to be installed to the Diablo 2 path that was most recently listed in the installer. If you install PlugY into the folder that you copy and paste, you will run into errors. So make the Diablo 2 folder that you copy and paste your unmodded Diablo 2, and the original folder will become the modded Diablo 2.
			- However, any pre-existing shortcuts for unmodded Diablo 2 will link back to the PlugY version, which can have issues listed in the warning above. Delete pre-existing shortcuts for Diablo 2, and create a new one from the unmodded Diablo 2 folder in the same way that is shown in steps 6-8 for `Diablo II.exe`.
		- So, if you have taken this step, your Diablo 2 folder for installing PlugY will be the original folder.
	2. *Otherwise, install it normally however you'd like. It does not matter.*
2. **Navigate to your Diablo 2 folder.**
	- For most users, your Diablo 2 folder will be located at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Diablo II\`.
3. **[Download PlugY v12.00 for Diablo 2 1.14d](https://github.com/haxifix/PlugY/raw/master/PlugY%20v12.00.zip).**
	- In the event the above link breaks, [visit here](https://github.com/haxifix/PlugY). Look for a `PlugY v12.00.zip` file. It may have been moved to *Releases*.
		- You can also view the current bugs with this version of PlugY [here](https://github.com/haxifix/PlugY/issues).
		- You can view the original PlugY site [here](http://plugy.free.fr/).
4. **Open `PlugY v12.00.zip`.**
5. **Take all of the files inside this .zip file and place them into your Diablo 2 folder.**
6. **Right click the `PlugYRun.exe` file that you just placed in your Diablo 2 folder. Press `Send to > Desktop (create shortcut)`.**
	- This creates a shortcut to launch PlugY from your desktop. You will need a shortcut either way to launch in windowed mode.
7. **Go to your Desktop, right click the PlugY shortcut we just created, and press `Properties`.**
8. **Go to the `Shortcut` tab of the Properties window. In the `Target:` box, add `-w` to the end.**
	- This will launch PlugY in windowed mode.
	- Your `Target:` box should read something similar to `"C:\Program Files (x86)\Diablo II\PlugYRun.exe" -w`.
		- The `"` at both ends of the path are required to add `-w` to the end.
9. **Use the shortcut on your desktop to play Diablo 2 with PlugY!**

##### Enjoy! :)


## If you are upgrading from 1.13 PlugY to 1.14 PlugY and wish to use your old saves, you will need to follow these steps as well:

1. **Go to your old PlugY installation. Your character saves will be in the Diablo 2 folder in the Save folder.**
2. **Move all these files to the 1.14 save location. This is found in your Saved Games folder.**
	- The Saved Games folder is usually located at `C:\Users\[your user]\Saved Games\Diablo II\`
3. **Lastly, you will have one or two `x_SharedStashSave.sss` files, depending on if you did or did not play both softcore and hardcore. You will need to rename one or both of them to have a `_` in front of the file name.**
	- For softcore, you will originally have a file named `LOD_SharedStashSave.sss`. It should be changed to read `_LOD_SharedStashSave.sss`.
	- For hardcore, you will originally have a file named `LOD_HC_SharedStashSave.sss`. It should be changed to read `_LOD_HC_SharedStashSave.sss`.
	- If your files already have a `_` in front, then you're all good!

##### Now you have your old saves moved over too! But be warned, PlugY v12.00 for Diablo 2 1.14d is relatively new. It has bugs. You should **DEFINITELY** back up your save files, including the `x_SharedStashSave.sss` files in the case something breaks.
