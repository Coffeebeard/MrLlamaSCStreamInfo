# Guide to Contribute

##### Note: edits to this file will not be accepted.

If you would like to contribute to any of the above pages or make your own page, you are welcome to! Do know that any changes, tips, tricks, or guides presented will have to be confirmed by me (Warren1001).

To get started, you can either:
	- Visit the page you would like to modify and press the edit button (![Edit](https://i.gyazo.com/e0befa85591c7151d9ea4a0f493c89ff.png)) and make your changes, OR
	- In the base of the repository (where you view this and can still see the other files), press `Add File` and press `Create New File`.
		- If neither of these options are available, you need to verify your e-mail to your account. If you do not have an account, you need one.

What this will do is it will create a clone of this repository under your account. You are free to edit it how you please.
